                  Meb Toys has taken initiative in very creative ways and manufactured educational toys for all age
                  groups. When the toys were shown to the kids in the class, the children went crazy, especially the
                  alphabet and number trays. All the teachers, as well as the children, loved the toys by Meb Toys</p>
